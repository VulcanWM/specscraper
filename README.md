# SpecScraper

## What is this?

SpecScraper is a simple CLI Python tool, which scrapes the entire AQA Physics A Level specification from its website, and turns it into JSON format. 
I will use this JSON file in my project specmap, which will turn the JSON file into a todolist.

# Next `steps?

This is the first release of specscraper.

It was originally intended to just scrape the website of the AQA Physics A level specification, but now I'm planning on making it scrape as many subjects in AQA as possible, and then move onto other exam boards as well.
