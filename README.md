# SpecScraper

## What is this?

SpecScraper is a simple CLI Python tool, which scrapes the entire AQA Physics A Level specification from its website, and turns it into JSON format. 
I will use this JSON file in my project specmap, which will turn the JSON file into a todolist.

## Next steps?

This is the first release of specscraper.

It was originally intended to just scrape the website of the AQA Physics A level specification, but now I'm planning on making it scrape as many subjects in AQA as possible, and then move onto other exam boards as well.

## Collaboration

I've currently identified the fact that this code only scrapes the first row of every table, but some specifications (like CS) use multiple rows. 
I would love it if someone could create a pull request fixing those changes.
